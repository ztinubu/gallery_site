		The day in chelsea provided a mixture of very diverse mediums ranging from sculpture to photo to intricate installation pieces. My friend and I began at the bruce silverstein gallery and worked our way around a 2 block radius. We started our visit viewing photos, a medium that is rather subdued or minimal in terms of physical form yet boasts novels in terms of subjective analysis. This allowed us to fulfil the function of the image, that being dialogue about what we had been viewing. Yet some photos had been dissected in physical form changing the typical dialogue one would have about the subjectivity of an image. The photo was presented in triptics taken at different times of the day in addition to different angles then molded together to make one continuous composition. Eventually we ended up at our last destination. Upon entering we had no context as to the subject of the gallery. We were greeted by a room full of luminescent colors and glossy textures filling the interior of the gallery. Almost as if an ikea had taken acid it was engaging but almost surreal in its experience. In my opinion, Form and function in contemporary art has been reinterpreted and skewed by the idea of process. Art seems almost interchangeable in the sense the monetary value we create for a piece is an indication of how much we value their artistic process. Who values that process, and where the best place to show that to an audience is.
